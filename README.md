# AirBnB clone - The console

## Background Context

It involves Creation of a command interpreter(Cmd) to manage the hbnb projects.
The AirBnB clone project is a step towards building first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because its a foundation which the following project will be built upon: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

* Each task is linked and it involves:
* putting in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
